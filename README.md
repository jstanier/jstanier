# Hello! :wave:

My name is James. Nice to meet you.  

I'm [Director of Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jstanier/) at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com). We enable millions of merchants around the world to run their businesses. I'm hiring, so get in touch if you're interested in working with me.

As well as building people and technology, I love writing.

* I published a book called [Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/). I wrote it to help other engineers make the leap into running teams.
* I run [The Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com) which is a blog to help people become better tech leads and managers.
* I'm in the middle of writing a second book for Pragmatic Programmers on remote working. It's being released in beta on 20th October 2021.

I'm on Twitter ([@jstanier](https://www.twitter.com/jstanier)) if you'd like to chat.
