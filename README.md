# Hello! :wave:

My name is James. Nice to meet you.  

I'm [Director of Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jstanier/) at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com). We enable millions of merchants around the world to run their businesses. I'm always hiring, so [get in touch](https://www.twitter.com/jstanier) if you want to make a real impact on how the world does business.

As well as building people and technology, I love writing.

* I am serving on the [Lead Dev advisory board](https://leaddev.com/advisory-board) for 2024.
* I published a book called [Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/). I wrote it to help other engineers make the leap into running teams.
* My second book called [Effective Remote Work](https://pragprog.com/titles/jsrw/effective-remote-work/) is about just that. Wherever you work from nowadays, your colleagues are likely to be somewhere else. It's about the tools and practices you need to succeed in that environment.
* A birdie told me that there is a third book underway...
* Also, I run [The Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com) which is a blog to help people become better tech leads and managers. You can subscribe to the mailing list [here](https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/embed) to get the articles in your inbox.

I'm on X ([@jstanier](https://www.twitter.com/jstanier)) if you'd like to chat. Else, you can contact me at `hello` at `theengineeringmanager.com`.
