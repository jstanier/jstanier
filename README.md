# Hello! :wave:

My name is James. Nice to meet you.  

I'm [SVP Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jstanier/) at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com).

As well as building people and technology, I love writing.

* :green_book:  I published a book called [Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/). I wrote it to help other engineers make the leap into running teams.
* :computer:  I run [The Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com) which is a blog to help people become better tech leads and managers.
