# Hello! :wave:

My name is James. Nice to meet you. I'm currently [CTO for Veterinary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jstanier/) at [Nordhealth](https://nordhealth.com/). I am incredibly lucky to build software that helps both animals and humans. ðŸ’š

As well as building people and technology, I love writing.

* I published a book called [Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager](https://pragprog.com/titles/jsengman/become-an-effective-software-engineering-manager/). I wrote it to help other engineers make the leap into running teams.
* My second book called [Effective Remote Work](https://pragprog.com/titles/jsrw/effective-remote-work/) is about just that. Wherever you work from nowadays, even if that's an office, your colleagues are likely to be somewhere else. It's about the tools and practices you need to succeed in that environment.
* My third book is called [Become A Great Engineering Leader](https://pragprog.com/titles/jsenglb/become-a-great-engineering-leader/), and it focusses on the leadership journey to Director, VP and beyond.
* Also, I run [The Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com) which is a blog to help people become better tech leads and managers. You can subscribe to the mailing list via Substack [here](https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/embed) to get the articles in your inbox.

I'm on X ([@jstanier](https://www.twitter.com/jstanier)) if you'd like to chat. Else, you can contact me at `hello` at `theengineeringmanager.com`.
