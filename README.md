# Hello! :wave:

My name is James. Nice to meet you.  

I'm [SVP Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jstanier/) at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com). We build the world's best digital consumer intelligence platform.

As well as building people and technology, I love writing.

* I published a book called [Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/). I wrote it to help other engineers make the leap into running teams.
* I run [The Engineering Manager](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com) which is a blog to help people become better tech leads and managers.

Since I spend most of my time on management and writing, you won't find a ton of public code on Github from the last few years. However, I'm still tinkering around for fun in private repositories, mostly following online courses.

I'm on Twitter [@jstanier](https://www.twitter.com/jstanier) if you'd like to chat.
